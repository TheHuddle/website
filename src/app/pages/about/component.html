      At first, open source can seem scary; contribution guidelines, licenses,
      and git history strategies are intimidating hurdles to clear. Our goal is
      to help you learn and practice open source best-practices in fun
      bite-sized chunks!

      Whether you're an experienced core-contributor or just starting your
      journey into open-source, our community has a place for you.
